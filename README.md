# hello-world
My first GitHub repository, and I am excited about it.
I am Emmanuella Fanji and I love this class. I am a young woman from Cameroon, an African country, who came to the US to pursue opportunities and live the American dream. I am passionate about technology and entrepreneurship. My goal is to launch my own startup in the next 2-3 years, the time for me to gain valuable skills. I have a few ideas already but I am still validating the concepts. 
I'm excited about what's ahead and can't wait to see what the future holds.
